# What's This?

Bruh is an attempt to make it easier to target modern browser API's in
development directly. There should be as few neccessary indirections as possible
between what is written and what is run. But at the same time, the development
cycle and production outputs should be tailored on an individual project level.

This is not a framework. It is a utilities library made exclusively for
developers who know what they are doing - a group which you might fit into.

# How do I Get It?

`npm install bruh`

# Where is the documentation?
