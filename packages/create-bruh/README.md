# `create-bruh` - Quickly start working with bruh

Simply run:
```sh
# Using npm
npm init bruh

# or npx...
npx create-bruh

# or yarn...
yarn create bruh

# or pnpm...
pnpx create-bruh
```

At the moment, the starter choices are:

- `vite`
- `vite-minimal`

`vite` is the recommended option because it enables extremely fast prerendering within vite, along with JSX.

If you don't see a template you like, keep in mind that bruh can simply be installed with `npm i bruh` and used in any project anyways.
